This is really dead easy

#1. Import the library:
At the top of the IO interface, use this line:

from commandlookup import processEval

#2. Use processEval()

Put the input string into processEval, and it'll do all the processing, and return the output.

output(processEval(myInput))

You're done! 

If you wanna split how different elements in the string are separated, use

processEval(inputStr,breakstring=myBreakString)

The terminal will have elements separated by new lines, while SMS uses |
