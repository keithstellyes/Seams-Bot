AS OF FEBRUARY 28 SEAMSBOT NOW SUPPORTS PROFILES

Profile information is stored as a JSON, with unique names to identify each profile.
Each profile can be used as aliases and to connect data across different phone numbers and other communication
mediums. Also, each command can read and write data to a unique string, accessed by an ID

For the budding command maker, it is useful to know the functions available

getProfile(name,key)
It gets the specific value to the key of the name. To get the profile, "Jim"'s real name, we can use
	getProfile("Jim","realname") to return the value assigned to "realname"

findProfileNameByKeyValue(key,value)
It returns the first profile name with a corresponding key and value. To see who ever's realname
is "Rusty Shackleford", one can use findProfileNameByKeyValue("realname","Rusty Shackleford")

findAllProfileNameByKeyValue(key,value)
Works exactly the same as above, but returns /all/ profile names that fall under the criteria.

//DATAZONE// DATA FUNCTIONS

profileGetData(ID,name="",phonenumber="",email="")
It gets data by first looking at the profile name, if not given then looks at phonenumber and finally email
Keeps code simple.

	The ID refers to the specific string identifying a value. It returns None if the ID isn't there
	name="" refers to the name of the individual profile objects, this is the best practice thing to refer to
	phonenumber="" a second-priority when a name isn't available or it isn't useful to keep track of names
		in a command.
	email="" while e-mail is not yet implemented, it will work like phone numbers.

~~SEE NOTE BELOW BEFORE USING THIS FUNCTION~~
profileWriteData(ID,name="",phonenumber="",email="",newData = "")
Works very similarly as profileGetData(), except that the data string corresponding ID is
overwritten with the newData object

~~NOTE~~
This does not currently support the writing of the sequence }, or the ' character
