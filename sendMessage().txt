While by default all commands return a value and that value is automatically sent to the recipient or to the
console if in the terminal interface, sometimes a message may want to send a message to a specific recipient, to do so...

This may also be used for special IO interfaces that may keep track of profiles

from sender import sendMessage

You'll be using the above code to import the method

sendMessage(message, ...)
	The message to send
sendMessage(,...mode="..."...
	The mode to send the message. 	
	As of writing, the only modes are
	"print" and "sms"
sendMessage(,...recipientOfSendMessage = "...")
	The recipient of the message. If this is not set,
	an exception is raised.

"How to phone home" via SMS

sendMessage("Hi",mode="sms","+15551234567")
